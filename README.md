pg_timetable: Advanced scheduling for PostgreSQL
================================================

**pg_timetable** is an advanced job scheduler for PostgreSQL, offering many advantages over traditional schedulers such as **cron** and others.
It is completely database driven and provides a couple of advanced concepts.

## 1. Main features

- Tasks can be arranged in chains
- A chain can consist of SQL and executables
- Parameters can be passed to chains
- Missed tasks (possibly due to downtime) can be retried automatically
- Support for configurable repetitions
- Builtin tasks such as sending emails, etc.
- Fully database driven configuration
- Full support for database driven logging
- Cron-style scheduling
- Optional concurrency protection

## 2. Installation

pg_timetable is compatible with the latest supported [PostgreSQL versions](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/): 11, 12 and 13. 

<details>
  <summary>If you want to use pg_timetable with older versions (9.5, 9.6 and 10)...</summary>
  
please, execute this SQL script before running pg_timetable:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION starts_with(text, text)
RETURNS bool AS 
$$
SELECT 
	CASE WHEN length($2) > length($1) THEN 
		FALSE 
	ELSE 
		left($1, length($2)) = $2 
	END
$$
LANGUAGE SQL
IMMUTABLE STRICT PARALLEL SAFE
COST 5;
```

### 2.1 Official release packages

You may find binary package for your platform on the official [Releases](https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/pg_timetable/releases) page. Right now `Windows`, `Linux` and `macOS` packages are available.

### 2.2 Docker

The official docker image can be found here: https://hub.docker.com/r/cybertecpostgresql/pg_timetable

The `latest` tag is up to date with the `master` branch thanks to [this github action](https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/pg_timetable/blob/master/.github/workflows/docker.yml).

CLI:

```sh
docker run --rm \
  cybertecpostgresql/pg_timetable:latest \
  -h 10.0.0.3 -p 54321 -c worker001
```

Environment variables:

```sh
docker run --rm \
  -e PGTT_PGHOST=10.0.0.3 \
  -e PGTT_PGPORT=54321 \
  cybertecpostgresql/pg_timetable:latest \
  -c worker001
```

### 2.3 Build from sources

1. Download and install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) on your system.
2. Clone **pg_timetable** using `go get`:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/pg_timetable.git
$ cd pg_timetable
```
3. Run `pg_timetable`:
```sh
$ go run main.go --dbname=dbname --clientname=worker001 --user=scheduler --password=strongpwd
```
Alternatively, build a binary and run it:
```sh
$ go build
$ ./pg_timetable --dbname=dbname --clientname=worker001 --user=scheduler --password=strongpwd
```

4. (Optional) Run tests in all sub-folders of the project:
```sh
$ psql --command="CREATE USER scheduler PASSWORD 'somestrong'"
$ createdb --owner=scheduler timetable
$ go test -failfast -timeout=300s -count=1 -parallel=1 ./...
```

### 3 Quick Start

A variety of examples can be found in the `/samples` directory.

Create a job with the `timetable.add_job` function. With this function you can add a new one-step chain with a cron-syntax.

| Parameter                   | Type    | Definition                                       | Default |
| :----------------------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------- |:---------|
| `job_name`     | `text`  | The name of the Task ||
| `job_schedule`        | `timetable.cron`  | Time schedule in сron syntax. `NULL` stands for `'* * * * *'`     ||
| `job_command` | `text`  | The function which will be executed. ||
| `job_client_name`   | `text`  | Specifies which client should execute the chain. Set this to `NULL` to allow any client. |NULL|
| `job_type`     | `text`  | Type of the function `SQL`,`PROGRAM` and `BUILTIN` |SQL|
| `job_max_instances` | `integer` | The amount of instances that this chain may have running at the same time. |NULL|
| `job_live`          | `boolean` | Control if the chain may be executed once it reaches its schedule. |TRUE|
| `job_self_destruct` | `boolean` | Self destruct the chain. |FALSE|
| `job_ignore_errors` | `boolean` | Ignore error during execution. |TRUE|

Run `public.my_func()` at 00:05 in August.
```SELECT timetable.add_job('execute-func', '5 0 * 8 *', 'SELECT public.my_func()');```

Run `VACUUM` at minute 23 past every 2nd hour from 0 through 20.
```SELECT timetable.add_job('run-vacuum', '23 0-20/2 * * *', 'VACUUM');```
    
## 4. Database logging and transactions

The entire activity of **pg_timetable** is logged in database tables (`timetable.log` and `timetable.execution_log`). Since there is no need to parse files when accessing log data, the representation through an UI can be easily achieved.

Furthermore, this behavior allows a remote host to access the log in a straightforward manner, simplifying large and/or distributed applications.
>Note: Logs are written in a separate transaction, in case the chain fails.

## 5. Runtime information

In order to examine the activity of **pg_timetable**, the table `timetable.run_status` can be queried. It contains information about active jobs and their current parameters.
